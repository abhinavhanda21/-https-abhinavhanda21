To expect a dark comedy from bollywood without copying is like expecting a sajid khan's movie to have a script. But this movie had a script and movie is great. I went to see this movie with mentality that movie is about raman raghav who a was serial killer who died in 90's. But no this movie is not about him. This movie is more than that. Movie revolves around 2 main characters raman (Nawazuddin) and raghavan (Vicky) . One is a serial killer and other is a cop. And trust me that's all you need to know. Talking about performances, Nawazuddin&nbsp; Siddiqui rocked the movie with his acting skills and he was perfect choice for this role. Vicky kaushik also plays important role and his acting is also great. Movie is dark, violent and has many comic moments moslty comedy is dark. If you really like drama movies with dark comedy go watch this movie. It's not a light hearted comedy basic bollywood type crap. I really liked the movie. The atmosphere of movie is dark, there is alot of blood spilling and pure evil killers. The sad part is movie didn't earn that much and shows were also less as compared to other bollywood crap(housefull3). We should encourage such good movies. I'll recommend to watch this movie.
