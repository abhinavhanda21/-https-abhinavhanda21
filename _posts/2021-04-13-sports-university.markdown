<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="rtejustify"> <b>Sports</b> has always been a integral part of any academic program. Starting from primary schools to all the way to universities sports go hand in hand with academic part of a studnets life. If you ask why should a computer student invest in any sport for betterment of his future? There is a simple answer a legend once said,"Football doesn't build character, it reveals character." Tenacity, Teamwork and discipline are some building block of life which cannot be learned in classroom. We learn how to handle defeat, how to abide by rules, learning from failure, work with a team and learn the essence of keep going no matter what are a few things we learn from sports acitivity. </p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>To sum up all the research, I believe that more and more students should need to be encouraged to join
sports. As I have discussed all the benefits in brief. If students want to keep themselves fit and away from
the ailments, then they should surely join. If you have any question you can
