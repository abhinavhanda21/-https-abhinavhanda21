<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="rtejustify"> <b>Sports</b> has always been a integral part of any academic program. Starting from primary schools to all the way to universities sports go hand in hand with academic part of a studnets life. If you ask why should a computer student invest in any sport for betterment of his future? There is a simple answer a legend once said,"Football doesn't build character, it reveals character." Tenacity, Teamwork and discipline are some building block of life which cannot be learned in classroom. We learn how to handle defeat, how to abide by rules, learning from failure, work with a team and learn the essence of keep going no matter what are a few things we learn from sports acitivity. </p>

<p>We know how feelings run high in sports – regardless of whether watching a game or playing it. Directing
negative feelings can be intense for kids and a decent mentor will assist them with acknowledging this
negative pressure. Each game requires some psychological, physical and strategic order. Adhering to
rules, complying with the mentor, rehearsing restrictions, and so forth are for the most part types of
control youngsters learn through sports. They additionally build up a feeling of having a place and get a
chance to make new companions. These correspondence and social abilities help them in their future
connections and professions. "There's no I in the group". Youngsters discover that the group can't win
except if they all work together and play to one another's qualities. They additionally figure out how to
turn out to be less self centered and not let conscience outdo them. Cooperating is a significant
characteristic in the present life and figuring out how to do so almost immediately assists kids with
turning out to be better cooperative people in proficient life. How to converse with different colleagues,
oversee group feelings, take one for the group, and so forth these are some values one can learn from
sports. They likewise put these abilities to use outside the pitch or court making them great pioneers that
others need to follow.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>To sum up all the research, I believe that more and more students should need to be encouraged to join
sports. As I have discussed all the benefits in brief. If students want to keep themselves fit and away from
the ailments, then they should surely join. If you have any question you can
