<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="rtejustify"> <b>Sports</b> have been seen as an approach to remain sound and fit as a fiddle, however their
significance goes a lot further. Actually, playing sports instructs life exercises like control, obligation,
fearlessness, responsibility, and cooperation. From a social point of view, sports are an amazing asset that
unites individuals and makes a local area. They create associations that bond together individuals from
varying backgrounds. Other than being fun, sports can assist you with performing school, loosen up more
and stress less, manage mishaps, work better with others and increment your energy which assists
students with adjusting school.<strong>SG90 Servo Motor</strong> in this tutorial, it is one of the popular and cheapest one. SG90 is a 180 degree servo. So with this servo we can position the axis from 0-180 degrees.</p>
