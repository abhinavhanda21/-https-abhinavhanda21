Leaflet.MovingMarker will allow to move markers along a polyline with custom durations. Go to <a href="https://github.com/ewoken/Leaflet.MovingMarker">leaflet</a> and clone the repository. In examples you will see script.js, open the file and change the zoom level, longitudes and latitudes.

Note: In leaflet (lat,lon) format is followed.

The output will be as following:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-417" src="https://abhinavhanda.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/screenshotslll.png" alt="screenshotslll" width="1366" height="768" />
