## Add Animation To maps:

view.animate() is used to add one or more animations. For a example of adding animation http://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/animation.html.

Here if you want to give your cities, just replace london to city you want to add. After replacing london with your city change longitude and latitude in line :

 var london = ol.proj.fromLonLat([-0.12755, 51.507222]);
Here enter your cities longitude and latitude. Also, change the zoom level according to your requirement.
